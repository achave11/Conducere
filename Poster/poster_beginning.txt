Things to include:
Our team name
Sentence or two about what we're doing (abstract)
Describe the three models that we're using
Include the name of the model
show the results from them- perhaps in a visual manner such as a graph
Method
Which model was the best? Percent of correctness
Conclusion
Were we able to determine music taste
which features were important in determining music taste

Info to include on models:
Features that were the most important to determining music taste, like 
danceability as originally found by the clustering model.
Graphs would be very nice to include. It would be easy to include the graphs on
the overall data- show the variations of some features. Maybe even include a
few songs and artists to show how the features change. There may be more
interesting graphs to show however, depending on what we find from the models.
